This is a web app game built using JavaScript and React.
Gameplay:
Rings appear in the tray at the bottom of the screen. They can be of 5 colors and 3 sizes. One tile can have up to one ring in each size slot.
Place rings on the gameboard. A ring or set of rings can be placed if there is space on the tile for each size of ring.
When there are at least three rings of the same color (size irrelevant) in a row/column/diagonal, they disappear and give one point per ring.
It can be played in freeplay mode or 1-minute timed games, with the top 5 timed scores of this session appearing on the left hand side.
